        The construction industry –a cornerstone in every economy worldwide– is at risk. 
        The sector’s productivity has barely grown 1% a year for the past two decades and profit margins are at an all-time low [1]. 
        As a result, <strong>construction companies must reduce costs</strong> and more specifically <strong>failure costs</strong>, that can account for up to 20% of the project’s budget [2]. 
        Failure costs are caused by (1) inefficient management of a building project, (2) <strong>failure to monitor progress</strong> resulting in delays and (3) <strong>failure to meet the quality 
        tolerances</strong> which lead to costly repairs. Furthermore, construction failures result in <strong>discrepancies between the reality and the designs</strong> which is a serious threat to industries 
        that rely on the spatial accuracy of the BIM once the structure is completed [3]. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A crucial step in reducing failure costs is to systematically monitor (progress, quality) the structure, architecture and MEP execution phases on construction sites [4]. 
        Current manual inspections cannot deliver on this as they are inaccurate, irregular and extremely labor-intensive [5]. 
        Therefore, construction site monitoring must be automated and digitized. 
        To spark innovation in this field, we present the <strong>ITC-KUL-CONSTRUCTOR dataset</strong>.

    <p>
        The dataset consists of two construction sites (<a href="https://saiga1105.github.io/ITC-KUL-CONSTRUCTOR/2020-02-28-ITC/">ITC</a> and <a href="https://saiga1105.github.io/ITC-KUL-CONSTRUCTOR/2020-02-28-KUL/">KUL</a>) 
        that were periodically captured using close-range sensing observations such as terrestrial laser scanners, hand-held imagery and so on. 
        The goal of this dataset is to to fuel 6 Open Source Competitions that will innovate construction site monitoring.

    <p>
        This Benchmark is powered by <a href="https://geomatics.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/research-projects/geomapi/">GEOMAPI</a>, a Python API developed by KU Leuven to manage close-range sensing observations. 
        It features functions to read and process all sorts of geospatial resources including point clouds, imagery, polygonal meshes and so on.
        In the <a href="https://github.com/Saiga1105/ITC-KUL-CONSTRUCTOR">REPOSITORY</a> attached to this benchmark, we provide a number of scripts to help you parse the data.
        The details on the parsing can be found on the individual competitions pages e.g. <a href="https://saiga1105.github.io/ITC-KUL-CONSTRUCTOR/2020-02-28-Competition_1_Alignment/">ITC</a>.
